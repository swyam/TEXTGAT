# TEXTGAT
Processing code is taken from Yao's implementation,

GCN is taken from Kipf implementation.

GAT is pytorch implementation of VeIickovic paper.

This project is based on  "Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Yao et al. AAAI2019." in PyTorch.

data and its processing is taken from source code  https://github.com/iworldtong/text_gcn.pytorch.

In this project, i tried to use GAT layer over graph obtained by procedure given in paper "Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Yao et al. AAAI2019".

The result were at par with TEXT_GCN(Yao's implementation)
