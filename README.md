# TEXTGAT
processing code is taken from yao'implementation,GCN is taken from Kipp implementation and GAT is pytorch implementation of VeIickovic paper.
This project based "Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Yao et al. AAAI2019." in PyTorch.
processing and data is taken from source code  https://github.com/iworldtong/text_gcn.pytorch.
this project tries to combine graph obtained by procedure given in paper "Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Yao et al. AAAI2019" and  graph attention network.
The result were at par with TEXT_GCN(Yao's implementation)
